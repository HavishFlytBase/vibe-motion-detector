## Getting Started

... This file is part of a library that aims at providing a matlab (not octave)
implementation of ViBe (for using it, pay attention to the fact that
it is a patented method, see comments below) and demonstrating how an
implementation of ViBe can be vectorized. Whereas ViBe can be extremely
fast, this library has not been optimized for speed.
